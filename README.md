# OSI Packet Flow Simulator

An interactive Flask web application that visualizes how different packet types
(HTTP, ICMP, ARP) traverse a network and interact with the OSI model.

This project is intended as a technical demonstration and learning tool.

## Why this project was developed

Modern software development increasingly involves AI-assisted workflows.
This repository demonstrates how AI can be used to:

- Rapidly prototype a system
- Translate abstract concepts (OSI model) into working software
- Iterate toward clarity, correctness, and maintainability

## Features

- Full OSI model sidebar with active-layer highlighting
- Multiple packet types with realistic OSI-layer behavior
- Device-level packet traversal visualization
- Flask backend

## Tech Stack

- Python (Flask)
- HTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript
- No external JS frameworks (intentionally)

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only and does not
represent a real production network.
